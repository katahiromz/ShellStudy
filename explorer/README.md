## What is "Explorer"?

In the context of Microsoft Windows operating systems, "Explorer" typically refers
to the File Explorer application. File Explorer is the file management application
that allows users to navigate and manage files and folders on their computer. It
provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the file system,
including features such as browsing directories, copying, moving, renaming,
deleting files, and creating new folders.
